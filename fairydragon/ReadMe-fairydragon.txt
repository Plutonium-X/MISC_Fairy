 Mischief (5 per day)

  Beware the pranks of the mischievous Fairy Dragon!
  The dragon may chose one of five practical jokes: 

  Prank :           Scare the target (50% propability to drop weapon)

  Throw Foul Egg :  The victim goes berserk for a short time, suspecting
                    the nearest bystander to be the egg-thrower.

  Ventriloguism :   Everyone around the target will run away scared,
                    effectively destroying any formation.

  Itching Powder :  Makes spellcasting impossible and makes it hard to
                    concentrate on physical attacking

  Lay Tripwire :    Enemies fall over the tripwire-trap and drop their weapons. 




 Search Berries. (1 per day)


  In outdoor areas, the Fairy Dragon may search for berries and other 
  small fruit, which it stacks (somehow, somewhere) in its inventory.

  Eating the fruit (via "Use Item" button) has special effects:

                Find Prob.     Inv. Max   Eating effect 

  Grapes          40%             1        Haste
  Strawberrys     10%             1        Rememorize all Spells
  Guril Berries    5%             1        Regeneration (1HP/3 Sec. for 30 Turns!)
  Blue Berries   100% / 55%       2        Heal 10 HP


  Note: 
   The Fairy Dragon may stack two blue berries; if it has actually none
   the probability to find one is 100%. After that, there's only a 55% chance 
   to find another. When the dragon has already two blue berries, it's just too 
   lazy to search for another, or maybe eats one of them while searching.

   The same applies for the other fruit. If the Fairy Dragon has already 
   one of them it won't get another.
